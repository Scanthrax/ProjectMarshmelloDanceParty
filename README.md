#GIT QUICK TIPS TO AVOID HOT FIXES:

When you create your repository select the gitignore for Unity.

Create new branches from Develop

Use a GIT GUI like Sourcetree or Github Desktop (really whatever your preference is).

Merge (or generate a pull request) only after Development is merged into your branch and TESTED

Make it so you have to do code reviews before anything is merged into a stable branch.

Only work on code and assets in your branch so other's changes are not overridden

Open asset packs in a separate Unity project to make sure they aren't hot garbage and only import pieces you need into your project to avoid game bloat.

Don't save your psds and large art files directly to the project convert them to their more economical sizes: TGA, PNG etc.
